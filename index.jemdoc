== About Me

As of June 3, 2019, I am building a startup with two friends, and we're based out of SF. Stay tuned. :)

I recently finished my PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford University. While at Stanford, I was a member of [https://web.stanford.edu/~dntse/ David Tse]'s group, and my research revolved around analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and understanding deep learning models. During the winter 2016 and spring 2018 quarters, I helped design and teach a new Stanford course on [http://data-science-sequencing.github.io/ data science for high-throughput sequencing]. I have also had the privilege of working for some wonderful organizations during my graduate and undergraduate careers including [https://grail.com/ Grail], [http://www.bd.com/en-us/offerings/capabilities/genomics Cellular Research], [https://www.mc10inc.com/ MC10], [https://ll.mit.edu/ MIT Lincoln Laboratory], and [http://www.dana-farber.org/ Dana-Farber].
