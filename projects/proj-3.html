<p> After a research collaboration with some members of <a http="http://www.serafimb.org/">Serafim Batzoglou's</a> group, I was inspired to explore how deep networks could improve the analysis of single-cell data. This project was done for the Stanford Artificial Intelligence course taught by <a http="http://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/">Percy Liang</a>. The results of a single-cell experiment can be summarized using a design matrix where each entry represents the expression level of a certain gene in a certain cell. The purpose of the project was to leverage the power of deep neural networks to clean the noisy design matrix such that biologically meaningful clusters could be uncovered using simple unsupervised learning algorithms such as <i>k</i>-means clustering. </p>

<p> The most challenging parts of the project involved solving a non-convex optimization problem using ADMM and building an appropriate network with which to process the data, neither of which I had done before. With the help of a <a http="http://web.stanford.edu/~meisamr/index.html">postdoc</a> in my group, I found a convex relaxation to the problem and derived the ADMM update equations. This was also my first practical experience working with deep networks, and luckily the <a http="http://keras.io/">Keras</a> documentation was fantastic.
