<p><b>Spring 2015</b></p>

<p>During the spring quarter of my first year of graduate school, I worked with a 2nd year neuroscience PhD student and a 5th year bioinformatics PhD student on this project for a machine learning in genomics course. With the advent of technologies able to sequence biological tissues at the single cell resolution, we attempted to identify novel genes that were useful for distinguishing neurons from non-neurons. Using a variety of techniques (k-means, consensus clustering, PCA, t-SNE, and random forests), we obtained some pretty neat clusters defined by a small set of genes. Check out the <a href="/projects/proj-3.pdf">report</a> we wrote up, which discusses the techniques and dataset we used in detail.</p>
