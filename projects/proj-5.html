<p><b>Spring 2012</b></p>

<p>At the end of my sophomore year at Tufts, I worked with 3 other classmates on a digital logic final project: designing and building a videogame on an 8x8 LED array using LSI/MSI/SSI logic. After investing about 100 total man-hours, we successfully interfaced on a breadboard the circuitry for a clock, row generator, user controls, memory, score keeper,  game display, collision detector, and character row generator. A working demo for the end result can be found in a (rather goofy) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WnnmJO5Uy4&feature=youtu.be">video</a> we made at the end of the project, and here's a picture of what the final product looked like: </p>
