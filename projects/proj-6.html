<p><b>Technologies:</b> MATLAB, Xcode <br>
<b>Key Words:</b> Kalman filter, active noise cancellation </p>

<p>For my two-semester-long senior electrical engineering capstone project, I worked with two classmates on creating an active ambient noise canceling iPhone application. The purpose of the project was to design an application that suppressed low-frequency components of ambient audio noise using no additional hardware other than the standard Apple headset (a cheap alternative to $300 Bose noise-canceling headphones). Over the course of our last year at Tufts, we met for about 8 hours weekly to tackle our most mathematically and algorithmically challenging project to date. We identified the hardware limitations of the system, designed and simulated a noise-canceling algorithm using MATLAB that adhered to the hardware limitations, and built an iPhone application prototype. Although we were thoroughly pleased that our simulation results showed that our algorithm suppressed low-frequency ambient noise, we ultimately could not overcome some fundamental hardware limitations. Specifically, we could not fully characterize the delay between when our application told the iPhone to play a sound and when the iPhone would actually output the sound.

Like in my Spring 2013 junior design course, we made a video advertising our work to prospective ECE students: </p>
