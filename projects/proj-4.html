<p> The last course I took for my Master's degree was <a href="http://cs224d.stanford.edu/">Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing</a> taught by <a href="www.socher.org">Richard Socher</a>. Working with <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~gkamath/">a fellow member of my research group</a>, we speculated that the deep learning models designed for sequential data such as natural language could naturally be applied to genomic sequences. For our final project, we first confirmed that a character-level recurrent neural network can capture the non-random parts of DNA by comparing the perplexity obtained after training on a real genome to that obtained after training on a random sequence of nucleotides. We then trained a bidirectional character-level RNN to predict whether a given genomic sequence would interact with a variety of transcription factors, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and histone marks. Because multiple biological objects can interact with a given sequence, we casted this latter problem as a multitask learning problem. We empirically showed how a deep network could outperform a baseline logistic regression model on a significant majority of 919 binary labeling tasks. We used epigenetic data from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">ENCODE</a> and <a href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping</a> consortia. Please see our <a href="http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/jessesz.pdf">writeup</a> for more details. The code is also available on <a href="https://github.com/jessemzhang/deep_learning_genomics_nlp">Github</a>.</p>
