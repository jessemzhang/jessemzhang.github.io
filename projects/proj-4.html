Upon coming to Stanford, I developed a strong interest in data science problems, and my first data science project came at the end of the Stanford machine learning course, taught by <a href="http://www.andrewng.org/">Andrew Ng</a>. Working with a first year computer science Masters student and a 3rd year aeronautics and astronautics engineering PhD student, we decided to test our newly acquired machine learning knowledge on a price prediction problem. More specifically, we determined whether certain Magic: The Gathering cards were worth investing in given some information about the card. We acquired a robust dataset of features by data mining websites such as <a href="http://mtgtop8.com/">mtgtop8.com</a> and collaborating with the creater of <a href="http://www.mtgprice.com/">mtgprice.com</a>. Using techniques such as regularized support vector machine and logistic regression, our prediction algorithm performed unexpectedly well in our contained environment.
