<p><b>Fall 2012</b></p>

<p>My first major electronics project came at the end of an electronics course I took in the fall semester of my junior year. Working with a fellow classmate, we designed the circuitry for an AM radio transmitter. After crunching out the values for the components, we simulated our result in LTSpice before heading over to the soldering station. We modulated our signal of interest using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colpitts_oscillator">Colpitts oscillator</a>, and we verified the final transmitter's performance with an actual radio. For more details, check out the <a href="/projects/proj-2.pdf">report</a> I wrote up for the project.</p>
