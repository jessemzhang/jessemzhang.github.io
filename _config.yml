blurb: <p><strong>Hi, I'm Jesse. </strong> I'm currently a third year PhD student in electrical engineering at Stanford University. I'm interested in data-related problems, and ultimately I hope to create something awesome that lies at the intersection of machine learning and  genomics. At the moment, I am a member of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~dntse/">David Tse</a>'s group, and my research revolves around analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. </p> <p>I was born in Beijing, and I grew up in the Boston area. After graduating from Newton South High School in 2010, I entered Tufts University as a biology major set on going to medical school. I'm not sure exactly what happened along the way, but somehow I ended up graduating with a degree in electrical engineering and a little extra knowledge about genetics. Outside of graduate school, I enjoy messing around on the piano, playing tennis, and going on spontaneous boba tea runs. </p> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessemzhang">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/jessemzhang">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4jViXZgAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>

jobs:
- {name: Cellular Research, logo: cellularresearch.jpg, dates: 'Jun. 2016 - Aug. 2016', description: '<p>As a bioinformatics intern at Cellular Research, I worked on <a href="http://www.cellular-research.com/resolve/">Resolve&#8482</a>, a cutting-edge technology that allows high-resolution investigation of 10,000s to 100,000s of single cells. Leveraging both the single-cell RNA-seq knowledge and machine learning techniques I gained from my first two years of graduate school, I built a full automated workflow for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data starting with a molecular counts matrix. I designed a novel approach for simultaneously clustering cells and selecting important gene markers for distinguishing the clusters.</p>', link: 'http://www.cellular-research.com/'}
- {name: MC10, logo: mc10.jpg, dates: 'May 2014 - Aug. 2014', description: '<p>MC10, inc. is a start-up that creates flexible devices for biomedical applications. As the signal processing guy in a three-person R&D intern team, I implemented machine learning and signal processing algorithms to facilitate real-time and offline accelerometer data analysis. I worked closely with the firmware team to optimize the hardware-software interface. At the end of my internship after weeks of debugging, I proudly presented an original algorithm that was selected to become the core feature of the company&#39;s first application on the market.</p>', link: 'http://www.mc10inc.com/'}
- {name: MIT Lincoln Laboratory, dates: 'Jun. 2013 - May 2014',logo: mitll.jpg, description: '<p>During my year at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, I worked as an intern/co-op for Group 33: Advanced Sensor Systems and Test Beds. I developed MATLAB algorithms to intelligently extract traces from ionogram images generated using data collected from an over-the-horizon radar system. During the process, I created a graphical user interface in MATLAB to facilitate ionogram image processing.</p>', link: 'https://www.ll.mit.edu/'}
- {name: Tufts Biomedical Engineering Department, logo: tuftsbme.jpg, dates: 'Sep. 2011 - Aug. 2012', description: '<p>While transitioning from a biology major to an electrical engineering major, I sought a research experience that laid at the intersection of the two disciplines. During my sophomore year, I worked with Min Tang-Schomer, who at the time was a postdoc in the David Kaplan group. I designed and constructed gold circuits on silk scaffolds to control and detect neuronal signals. I then processed and analyzed the signals using pCLAMP software.</p>', link: 'http://engineering.tufts.edu/bme/kaplan/'}
- {name: Tufts Academic Resource Center, logo: tuftsarc.jpg, dates: 'Aug. 2012 - May 2014', description: '<p>During my two-year experience as a head tutor for the Tufts Academic Resource Center, I tutored introductory physics, introductory chemistry, calculus III, differential equations, and linear algebra. In addition to hosting weekly office hours and 1-on-1 sessions, I also collaborated with other tutors and professors to lead large-scale review sessions and residential events.</p>', link: 'http://uss.tufts.edu/arc/'}
- {name: Dana Farber Cancer Institute, logo: danafarber.jpg, dates: 'May 2011 - Aug. 2011', description: '<p>After my freshman year at Tufts, I worked with Hansen He, who at the time was a postdoc in the Myles Brown group at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Using an epigenetics approach, I conducted wet-lab experiments such as PCR, ChIP-chip, and western blotting to define role of lysine-specific demethylase 1 in human prostate cancer. The results were analyzed using Excel, python, and visualization tools at cistrome.org. I was proud to play a small role in a project that ended up being published in <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00962-0">Cell Reports</a>. </p>', link: 'http://research4.dfci.harvard.edu/brownlab/'}
